## Pixel Creator

With the [Pixel Creator](https://pixelit.bastelbunker.de/PixelCreator) you can create your own images (aka BPM) and upload them in the Pixel Gallery. It will then be available to you and all other users.  
::: tip Tipp
To use the function of **LiveDraw active** as well as **Show on PixelIt**, you must enable **Allow mixed content** in the browser. 
There is a good [manual from Adobe](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/vec/troubleshoot-composer/mixed-content.html?lang=en#task_FF297A08F66E47A588C14FD67C037B3A).
